# ARPEGGIO ON RUST

This is the Arpeggio coding template based on [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Scripts

You can execute it by using Cargo (already included in Rust installation):

```bash
cargo run
```

And tests execution by:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Dependencies

Arpeggio on Rust keeps the codebase clean by including only the minor requirement tooling dependency as they are _async-trait + tokio_ for asynchronicity features.

## The Plan Concept example
